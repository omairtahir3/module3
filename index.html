                <p>Chickens are average-sized fowls, characterized by smaller heads, short beaks and wings, and a round body perched on featherless legs. Exact size varies greatly among breeds, as does color. In many breeds, both sexes will have fleshy skin folds on the chin and atop the head, known as wattles and combs, respectively. Chickens have four claws on each foot, which are used to scratch into the earth to find food. Males, known as roosters or cocks, tend to be larger than females, or hens, and often have more pronounced wattles and combs and more elaborate plumage. Chicken are the best food meals you could try at our place which will serve you with great delight.  If you think that an amount of money is so small it is hardly worth having or considering, you can say that it is chicken feed. I was making a million a year, but that's chicken feed in the pop business. The top three ingredients in most Nature's Best bagged chicken feeds are corn, soybean meal, and wheat or wheat middlings. When you look at the ingredients list of many types of chicken feed, you may also find: Cereals and cereal byproducts: Cereals in feed may include wheat, corn, sorghum, barley or rye. Candy corn was not the original name of the sweet.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center"><b>Beef</b></h3>
                <p>The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. In beef production there are three main stages: cow-calf operations, backgrounding, and feedlot operations. The production cycle of the animals starts at cow-calf operations; this operation is designed specifically to breed cows for their offspring. Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat — a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers. Beef is the meat of a cow. In English, we use the word “beef”, from the Old French word “boeff”, instead of saying “cow meat”. English uses a lot of French-derived words because the French Normans conquered and ruled England about 1000 years ago. The meat of mature or almost mature cattle is mostly known as beef. Beef is a good source of protein and other nutrients, but is also high in cholesterol and saturated fats that can cause fatty deposits to build up in the blood. Beef can be a healthy part of your diet, but should be eaten in moderation.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center"><b>Shushi</b></h3>
                <p>Besides the common Armenian name Shushi, the town has historically been referred to in Armenian by various names, including Shoshi/Shushva Berd, Shoshi Sghnakh, Shoshvaghala, which all mean "Shosh/Shushi Fortress".Sushi comes from a Japanese word meaning "sour rice," and it's the rice that's at the heart of sushi, even though most Americans think of it as raw fish. In fact, it's the word sashimi that refers to a piece of raw fish. In Japanese, the word sushi means “sour rice” (the rice is traditionally moistened with rice vinegar). The word sashimi comes from the Japanese sashi, meaning “pierce” or “stabbing,” and mi, “flesh” or “body.” Many people associate sushi with a raw fish or seafood element, and it often includes these, but not always.It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
